    "# ER Tank Mesh Generation\n",
    "## Run mode: ERTtank1    \n",
    "In this example, we build a mesh of a laboratory tank.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the run mode ERT1 example (mode_ERT1) the defined surface boundaries (flag=2) were far enough away from the electrode locations such that these boundaries did not influence the data; surface boundaries were defined in mode ERT1 as having zero potential.  In contrast, in a laboratory tank, the tank boundaries are close enough to the electrodes to influence the data.  Therefore in run mode ERTtank1, surface boundaries (i.e. tank boundaries)  (flag=2) are computationally equivalent to defining a zero flux boundary.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The other difference in a laboratory tank is a ghost node must be defined to use the mesh in the forward and inverse modeling run modes.  E4D simulates potentials by solving for the pole solution at each electrode and subtracting the potential generated by the current sink electrode.  For  example, the total potential Pt between electrode A and B is solved as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pt=PA-PB  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the tank boundaries prevent computing the solution of PA and PB directly, so a ghost node is used which serves as the current sink electrode for every pole solution.  Since the same ghost sink is used for every electrode pole solution, the effects of the sink cancel out when the potential from the current sink is subtracted from the potential from the current source.  In modes ERTtank1 and SIPtank1, the total potential  Pt between electrode A and B, where the ghost sink is Pg is computed as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pt=(PA-Pg)-(PB-Pg)\n"
