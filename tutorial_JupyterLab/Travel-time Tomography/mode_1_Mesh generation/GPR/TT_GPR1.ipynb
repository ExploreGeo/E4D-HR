    "Mesh generation in travel-time tomography is analogous to mesh generation for an electrical method application.  The main difference is that the boundary for the travel-time tomography does not need to be extended to a large distance beyond the area of imaging.  This is due to the differences in the  boundary conditions: in the fast-marching method, the algorithm used in E4D, the discretization only need compass the area surrounding the source and receiver locations.
