# E4D-HR

E4D-HR is a fork of [E4D](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/e4d), a 3D geophysical modelling and inversion tool originally developed by PNNL. This project aims to continue the development of E4D, introducing modifications tailored towards mineral exploration use cases. E4D is designed for subsurface imaging, using direct current resistivity and induced polarisation methods for geophysical modelling and inversion.

### Automatic Installation

To automatically install E4D-HR, use the provided `install.py` script. This script handles the setup of dependencies and the compilation of E4D-HR.

1. Ensure the Intel oneAPI environment variables environment variables are configured.

   [Use the setvars and oneapi-vars Scripts with Linux](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/programming-guide/2025-0/use-the-setvars-and-oneapi-vars-scripts-with-linux.html#HOW-TO-RUN)

   ```bash
     source <oneapi-dir>/setvars.sh
     ```
   
3. Navigate to the E4D-HR directory containing the `install.py` script.
   
4. Run the script:
   ```python3 install.py```

The script will build E4D-HR and third party libraries, prompting as needed.

### Manual Installation

See the E4D-HR user guide for information regarding manual installation.
